        "**\"What is Machine Learning?**\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to \"learn\" with data,\n",
        "without being explicitly programmed.\n",
        "\n",
        "To put it in simpler terms, Machine Learning is all about learning from data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Explicit programming involves writing code for each specific scenario. To handle that scenario, you write a code.\n",
        "\n",
        "But in Machine Learning, you don't do that. You've got some data and you've got an algorithm. You instruct the algorithm to explore the data and identify patterns between input and output. Once you've identified the patterns, we provide new input to the algorithm to derive the output.\n",
        "\n",
        "you can observe that in conventional programming approach we write a program\n",
        "for which logic is written by us. If you give input to that program, you'll get your output. But in Machine Learning, things are different. What you do is you provide some data - an input as well as an output. But you haven't written any program or logic. That logic is generated by none other than the Machine Learning algorithm. The good part is that you don't have to write code\n",
        "for each condition/case. It is automatically handled by Machine Learning algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, you've written code for adding two numbers. Whenever you give two numbers to that program, it returns you the value of sum. But in Machine Learning, what you will do is you give data You'll give an excel file in which the rows contain the numbers and their respective sum. Whenever Machine learning models train on that data, The model realises the pattern as addition.\n",
        "After training, irrespective of giving two or four or ten numbers as an input,\n",
        "your machine learning model knows that it has to perform addition. It adds all of them and gives to you. Whereas in the code written for sum of two numbers,\n",
        "If you give more than two numbers as input,then the program doesn't function\n",
        "since it is explicitly coded to perform sum of two numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**When and where Machine Learning is used?**\n",
        "\n",
        "First scenario is that you can't perform few things using programming\n",
        "You can't write cases for everything.In such situations, we use Machine Learning. Consider that you are trying to build an e-mail spam classifier\n",
        "to detect whether the given email is spam or not. If you were given to write a programfor that as a software developer then what would you possibly do? you will pick a bunch of e-mails and you'll have the information about that e-mail, whether is spam or not. then you will try to create patterns for them. like any word such as 'discount' or 'sale' or 'awesome' is repeated more often or it is filled with bunch of pictures, then you create a long if-else ladder by using if else for each and every condition. That would be the possible program\n",
        "for you Spam classifier.But let us say that you've written something like\n",
        "if 'huge' is repeated more than three times, huge as in discount is used,\n",
        "you'll label that e-mail to be spam. And somehow advertising companies\n",
        "got to know that. If code is written to classify the mail as spam if the\n",
        "world is repeated more than three times then those companies might use 'big'\n",
        "or 'massive' instead of 'huge' then the program couldn't pick that mail as spam. then you've to modify the logic of the code to handle a new scenario\n",
        "but again, advertising companies can experiment with different words if they get to know about it. In short, you've to keep changing the logic more frequently to make sure that the code runs effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In machine learning, it doesn't happen that way. Since it learns from data, if data changes, then it will automatically get reflected in logic.You just have to write just one algorithm, and everything will be handled by that algorithm itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "Second scenario where Machine Learning is useful over traditional programming\n",
        "A scenario where you cannot even imagine the number of cases like 'Image Classification'. Let us say you want to classify dogs, that if dog is present in picture or not. There will be hundreds of breeds which varies in looks,\n",
        "few large and few short, vary in colours and other characteristics.\n",
        "So, if you were to create a program that detects the presence of dog in a picture Can you imagine the number of cases you've to write inorder to cover characteristics of every breed? You cannot do so. You cannot code it\n",
        "We have use the technique that we, humans,use to identify dogs. We were thought from our childhood to identify that particular animal is dog.That one is not a dog, that is a cat. Our mind mentally keeps tagging the name with the animal\n",
        "It keeps learning from the data. It is also one of the scenarios where you cannot use conventional software development approach. You'll have to use the Machine Learning approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "One more important use case is Data Mining. First, let's discuss about what data analysis is. Data analysis is a process where you extract patterns or search for hidden information by plotting graphs. That is 'Data Analysis'\n",
        "but sometimes the information is more hidden which you won't be able to get through graphs. I'll give you one scenario.Just by looking at the e-mail content, if we're unable to detect key words due to which we can classify the e-mail as spam, then you perform Data Mining. In Data Mining, you apply Machine Learning algorithm on the data. You create a prediction model just like e-mail spam classifier. You can check the patterns extracted by the Machine Learning model like if 'huge' is occurring more frequently, then there it is labeled as a spam if it is not that frequent, it is treated as not spam. After applying Machine Learning, if you are able to extract important data from the information, that is known as \"Data Mining\". Most of the times in order to extract the hidden patterns, in order to perform such data analysis,we use Machine Learning and this is called as Data Mining\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "All the theory and Maths existed from very long time but machine learning is not that famous because of the reason that machine learning requires significant amount of data. Unfortunately,back then gathering and labelling\n",
        "the data is a quite tedious task. Also, the inefficiency of hardware to run algorithms on such data back then. After 2010, with evolution of internet and smartphone, these two problems are sorted out. We are generating data at a heavy pace.Second thing is hardware.In the modern day world, we ourselves are carrying up to 12GB of RAM in our pocket in the form of mobile. We are carrying GPUs in our pocket which were not available to research scientists. Even 128MB RAM was a big deal then but we are equipped with good hardware,data and algorithms now .That is the reason why machine learning is enjoying it's fruits."
